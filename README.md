## For  ActiveBuildings Assignments

## Task
1.  Here is a link of real time air quality data source [https://air-quality.com/place/india/gurugram/d2853e61?lang=en&standard=aqi_us](https://air-quality.com/place/india/gurugram/d2853e61?lang=en&standard=aqi_us)
    
2.  Use the link mentioned in the point above, scrape all the pollutants readings from the web page.
    
3.  Create a rest api using the Django framework to fetch the scraped pollutant data. The pollutant data should be returned as a simple key value pair, you can use any keys of your choice to represent the data.
4. Host this service on netlify/heroku or your local machine.
5. Share your code with the necessary documentation.

So for this assignment I have created a RestAPI along with the HTML template to render the data of the pollutant.
